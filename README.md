## Moved to Github for Version 2.0
Version 2.0
By Mnkyking

### Change Log
2.0 -> 2022 April 24


## Introduction
This plugin is a substitute in place of the default menu. Developers can set your own Menu Commands, Actions for those Menu Commands and plugin is built with "mobile phone" as template. Although this menu could work with other UI forms.

Why Version 2.0 and move to Github?
I (Mnkyking) decided to push the plugin to Github to allow for more collaboration and for better issue tracking. This new version will enhance and improve upon version 1.0 and possibly combine the Original Menu with the Addon and attempt to keep this as a standalone plugin which will not fail with other plugins.
